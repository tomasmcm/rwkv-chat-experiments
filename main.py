# fp16 = good for GPU (!!! DOES NOT support CPU !!!)
# fp32 = good for CPU
# bf16 = worse accuracy, supports CPU
# xxxi8 (example: fp16i8, fp32i8) = xxx with int8 quantization to save 50% VRAM/RAM, slower, slightly less accuracy
#
# We consider [ln_out+head] to be an extra layer, so L12-D768 (169M) has "13" layers, L24-D2048 (1.5B) has "25" layers, etc.
# Strategy Examples: (device = cpu/cuda/cuda:0/cuda:1/...)
# 'cpu fp32' = all layers cpu fp32
# 'cuda fp16' = all layers cuda fp16
# 'cuda fp16i8' = all layers cuda fp16 with int8 quantization
# 'cuda fp16i8 *10 -> cpu fp32' = first 10 layers cuda fp16i8, then cpu fp32 (increase 10 for better speed)
# 'cuda:0 fp16 *10 -> cuda:1 fp16 *8 -> cpu fp32' = first 10 layers cuda:0 fp16, then 8 layers cuda:1 fp16, then cpu fp32
#
# Basic Strategy Guide: (fp16i8 works for any GPU)
# 100% VRAM = 'cuda fp16'                   # all layers cuda fp16
#  98% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 *1 -> cuda fp16' # first 1 layer  cuda fp16i8, then cuda fp16
#  96% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 *2 -> cuda fp16' # first 2 layers cuda fp16i8, then cuda fp16
#  94% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 *3 -> cuda fp16' # first 3 layers cuda fp16i8, then cuda fp16
#  ...
#  50% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8'                 # all layers cuda fp16i8
#  48% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 -> cpu fp32 *1'  # most layers cuda fp16i8, last 1 layer  cpu fp32
#  46% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 -> cpu fp32 *2'  # most layers cuda fp16i8, last 2 layers cpu fp32
#  44% VRAM = 'cuda fp16i8 -> cpu fp32 *3'  # most layers cuda fp16i8, last 3 layers cpu fp32
#  ...
#   0% VRAM = 'cpu fp32'                    # all layers cpu fp32
#
# Use '+' for STREAM mode, which can save VRAM too, and it is sometimes faster
# 'cuda fp16i8 *10+' = first 10 layers cuda fp16i8, then fp16i8 stream the rest to it (increase 10 for better speed)
#
# Extreme STREAM: 3G VRAM is enough to run RWKV 14B (slow. will be faster in future)
# 'cuda fp16i8 *0+ -> cpu fp32 *1' = stream all layers cuda fp16i8, last 1 layer [ln_out+head] cpu fp32
